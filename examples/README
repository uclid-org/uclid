cpu_induction.ucl
- This is an extension of the the CPU model from Chapter 4 of the tutorial. It
  adds an isolated mode of execution to the CPU, and proves non-interference 
  between isolated mode and normal mode using an inductive argument.

setuid.ucl
- This is a model based on the automaton in the paper:
  Setuid Demystified. Chen, Wagen and Dean [Usenix Security 2002].

setuid_fixed.ucl
 - This is a "fixed" version of the setuid model.

two-safety.ucl
 - This is an example of verifying a simple hyperproperty (a 2-safety property)
   by self-composition. It is based on an example in Chapter 17 of Lee & Seshia.

simple-datapath.ucl
  - This is an example from the original UCLID work on processor verification (Bryant, Lahiri, Seshia, CAV'02),
    showing Burch-Dill style correspondence (refinement) checking.
